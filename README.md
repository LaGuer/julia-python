This example shows how you can install a Julia and Python environment side-by-side.
In this repository are *both* an `environment.yml` file as well as a `REQURE` file.
The former corresponds to an anaconda python environment, and the latter corresponds
to a Julia environment. Both kernels will be available to you in a built Binder
environment.
